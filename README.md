# MyTeenyTinyCompiler

My practice code following:

- [Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html)
- [Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 2](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html)
- [Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 3](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html)

The author's origin code is hosted at [AZHenley/teenytinycompiler](https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler). 

P.S. It's not good practice to use `camelCase` instead of `snake_case` in python though.
